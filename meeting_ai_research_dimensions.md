# Research Dimensions in Meeting AI

Meeting AI research spans multiple dimensions that collectively aim to enhance the effectiveness, intelligence, and human compatibility of automated meeting systems. These dimensions not only address core technological capabilities but also consider behavioral, cultural, and autonomous system aspects.

## 🧠 Dimension 1: Core Meeting Understanding and Intelligence

This dimension focuses on the fundamental AI capabilities required to accurately capture and comprehend the content and context of a meeting.

### 🔄 Multimodal Data Fusion
- Combine audio, video, and text to form a unified understanding of meetings.
- Research Challenge: Develop **cross-modal attention mechanisms** to go beyond single-modality insights.

### 🗣️ Advanced Speaker Diarization and Recognition
- Answer the key question: **"Who spoke when?"**
- Tackle overlapping speech, background noise, and maintain speaker consistency across multiple sessions.

### 📑 Content Intelligence and Structuring
- Move from raw transcription to structured understanding.
- Key capabilities:
  - Detecting **agenda topics**
  - Identifying **action items** and **decisions**
  - Generating **structured summaries**
  - Predicting **meeting outcomes**

### 🌐 Domain-Specific Language Understanding
- Accurately process specialized terminology and **code-switching**.
- Applications in domains such as:
  - **Healthcare** (medical terms, patient safety meetings)
  - **Law** (legal jargon, courtroom dialogue)

## 🤝 Dimension 2: Behavioral Analytics and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

This dimension explores how humans behave in meetings and interact with the AI system, with the goal of improving usability and collaboration.

### 👥 Group Dynamics and Engagement Analysis
- Use multimodal cues (e.g., speech, gestures, expressions) to assess:
  - Engagement levels
  - Sentiment and mood
  - Participation equity
- Understand communication **patterns** and **team dynamics**.

### 🧑‍💻 User Experience of AI Intervention
- Study the **impact of AI assistance** on natural conversation flow.
- Research aims to define:
  - Helpful vs. disruptive AI behavior
  - Effective UI/UX for real-time AI guidance

### 🔐 Trust and Acceptance of Meeting AI
- Explore what makes users trust meeting automation tools.
- Design **intuitive, non-intrusive interfaces** to build user confidence and long-term adoption.

### 🌍 Cross-Cultural System Design
- Consider how **cultural variations** affect meeting styles.
- Design AI that adapts to differing **etiquette, expressions, and communication norms**.

## 🤖 Dimension 3: Adaptive and Autonomous Meeting Systems

This dimension envisions smart meeting systems that not only assist but also autonomously manage meetings in real-time.

### 🧭 AI-Driven Facilitation and Moderation
- Build AI agents that act as **neutral moderators**.
- Key functions:
  - Ensure equal speaking opportunities
  - Keep meetings on-topic
  - Assist in **conflict resolution** or **summary conclusions**

### ⏱️ Dynamic Agenda and Time Management
- Automatically **adjust the meeting agenda** based on discussion flow.
- Real-time topic prioritization and timing adjustments to ensure meeting effectiveness.

### 🧑‍🎓 Personalized Meeting Experiences
- Tailor meeting outputs to individual participants:
  - **Role-based summaries**
  - Relevance-based highlights
- Support **post-meeting personalization** and **task follow-ups**.
